## [Clinically Adaptable Machine Learning Model To Identify Early Appreciable Features of Diabetes In Bangladesh](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667102623000049)
The research was done using following steps: 
* Collected 561 samples of data through google forms and diabetes dataset from [Sylhet Diabetes Hospital](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishandutta/early-stage-diabetes-risk-prediction-dataset).
* Used statistical methods (correlation, t-test) to analyze the data significant features on three sets of data (collected data, Sylhet Diabetes Hospital data and Combined data).
* Used different machine learning models for diabetes classification.
* Used SHAP analysis to see how the models are performing on different features in the data.
